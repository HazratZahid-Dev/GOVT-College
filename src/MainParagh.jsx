            Keeping in mind the pathetic situation of education being imparted by the educators, Laurels College of Sciences was established with the aim to revolutionize the education system of district Kurram. At Laurels, we will strive to provide quality education at the door step. Laurels College will be unique amongst its competitors as we will focus on much broader aspects such as personality and psychological development of students. Furthermore, we will provide favorable environment for teaching and learning to take effect. Based on five core values (punctuality, discipline, respect, honesty and commitment) we will try our best to inculcate the same in our students so that they may succeed in their academic and professional careers ahead.
